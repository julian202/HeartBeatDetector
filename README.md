HeartBeatDetector
=================

A program that uses a camera to detect heart beats in real time. This program has been used to trigger image acquisition using x-ray or confocal microscopes of hearts at equal time points during the heartbeat cycle. Each beat triggers a signal that is sent via an arduino board to the corresponding machine. Requires a Pointgrey Firefly Camera. Written in C# Visual Studio 2015.
